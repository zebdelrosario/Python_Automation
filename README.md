This repository contains various personal automations projects that aim to make tedious daily tasks easier to deal with.

If not already in the repo; these are some future projects I aim to cover:

<h2>Administration tasks.</h2>
<h3>Folder generator</h3>
<p>This program intends to make life easier for office administrators that make heavy use of the old-school filing 
system, where the months January - December are generated as folders , and inside them have their corresponding amount 
of days generated.
</p>
Example:
Generate months Jan - March will:
<ol>
<li>Generate folders January, February and March.</li>
<li>Generate the corresponding amount of folders inside the respective month; e.g.: January will generate 31 folders. 
(This works with leap years as well)</li>
</ol>
